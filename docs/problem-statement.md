# Problem Statement – Pipe Inspection Robot

## Objective
Design and develop a compact, mobile robot capable of inspecting internal sections of pipelines with minimal human intervention. The robot must navigate horizontal, inclined, and vertical sections while transmitting sensory and visual data in real-time.

---

## Pipe Specifications
- **Internal Diameter Range:** 150 mm – 200 mm  
- **Minimum Bend Radius:** As per standard industrial pipe bends (to be measured and tested during prototyping)  
- **Incline Angles:** 0° to 90° (horizontal to vertical orientation)

---

## Performance Targets
- **Target Speed:** 0.1 – 0.3 m/s (adjustable based on terrain and slope)
- **Bidirectional Movement:** Must be capable of forward and reverse motion
- **Maximum Total Mass:** ≤ 4 kg (including electronics and sensors)

---

## Sensor & Instrumentation Requirements
- **Camera Module:** For visual inspection and live streaming
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** For orientation and stability monitoring
- **Gas Sensor:** For hazardous gas detection in pipelines
- **Encoders:** For odometry and movement feedback

---

## Functional Goals
1. Autonomous or semi-autonomous movement through pipes.
2. Real-time data acquisition and transmission.
3. Stable traversal through bends and inclines.
4. Modular and maintainable mechanical and electrical design.
